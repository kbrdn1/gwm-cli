## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **The Working Tree listing reads as columns**
  ([#622](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/622)). The `M` / `A` / `D`
  / `?` status letter used to lead the file name, so on a 27-file change set
  it sat at a different offset on every row and the eye had to re-find it. It
  is now a right-aligned column of its own, in both the sidebar pane and the
  full-size overlay, and it keeps the per-category colour it always had.

  Both surfaces place the column one gap past the longest row rather than
  against their border. The sidebar is stacked by default, so on a wide
  terminal a border-flush letter lands a hundred cells from the name it
  describes, which is the opposite of the fixed column the issue asked for.
  The `+N -M` counts from #592 move with it, since they had the same problem
  on a 90%-of-the-screen overlay.

  In the overlay the letter shares the right end of the row with those counts,
  and the two yield in a fixed order: the letter is carved out first, so a
  narrowing terminal drops the counts and never the letter. `+N -M` says how
  much a file changed, the letter says what happened to it, and a row that no
  longer says what it is has lost its subject rather than a detail.

  The overlay title carries the changed-file count, `Working Tree (27)`. It
  comes from the per-category counts rather than the row count, so it agrees
  with the footer: the rows also hold directories, the `… N more` overflow
  notice and the `✓ clean` sentinel, none of which is a changed file. It is
  withheld while the listing is still being read, since `(0)` there would be a
  claim rather than a count.

  Directory rows lead with a `▾` disclosure caret instead of the folder glyph
  they carried since #300. A folder glyph and a file glyph are two icons of
  the same weight, which left indentation alone to separate the two levels;
  a caret is a different shape. File rows keep their per-extension glyph.

  The collapsed leading path the issue also asks for was already there:
  `build_tree` has folded single-child directory chains into one `a/b/c` row
  since #300.
